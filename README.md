# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This application can be ran by downloading the source code, jumping into the applications root directory then running:

## "NPM I" -- To install your packages

## "NPM RUN START" -- To start the application

Once application has been started, you can navigate to the search page on http://localhost:3000

Inside the search page you should be able to perform 3 types of actions within the application.

1. You can type in a ingredient (I usually use Chicken, Tea, & Turkey).
2. Next, by default is 10, but you an change how many cards(recipes) appear on the page.
3. & lastly, you have pagination, to go through the pages.
